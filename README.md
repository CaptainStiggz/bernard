# bernard
A computer vision/machine learning testbed.

## Noteable files
(cv.py)[https://github.com/CaptainStiggz/bernard/blob/master/cv.py] - a testbed for various new image filters (entropy filtering, symmetry filtering, etc.)
bvision.py - implementations of image filters
bayes.py - implementations of naive bayes filters (guassian, multinomial, bernoulli)
neural.py - numpy implementation of basic neural networks and various enhancements (sigmoid/ReLU/tanh activation, fully-connected/softmax layers, L2 regularization, dropout, cross-entropy/log-linear/quadratic cost)
